# Session handoff — read this first

Written 2026-09-24 from a `thinkpad` session. **The next session runs on
`optiplex`.** You inherit no conversation context; everything you need is
here and in `refs/polybar-migration-findings.md` (the deep, source-verified
ledger — this file is the map, that file is the proof).

## The setup

- Chezmoi Linux desktop config repo (`github.com/renownitall/dotfiles`,
  branch `main`). `.chezmoiroot` = `home`, so `home/dot_config/x` deploys to
  `~/.config/x`.
- **Two machines, one repo.** `thinkpad` = Sway/Wayland + waybar + fuzzel +
  SwayFX shadows. `optiplex` = i3/X11 + polybar + rofi + picom + dunst.
  Per-machine split lives in `home/.chezmoiignore` (optiplex block line 13,
  thinkpad block line 27) and `data/packages.json` (`machines` → onboarding
  picks the list by hostname). Consequence: on thinkpad, `chezmoi diff` never
  shows rofi/i3/picom/polybar files (ignored), and on optiplex it never shows
  waybar/sway/fuzzel files. Templates that deploy on both (dunst, dunst-dnd,
  systemd units) may branch with `{{ if eq .chezmoi.hostname "optiplex" }}` —
  precedent: `polkit-agent.service.tmpl`, now also `dunstrc.tmpl`.
- Working rules: **`AGENTS.md`** — verify before changing, smallest necessary
  change, palette changes go `meta/color-scheme.md` → `make palette` →
  consumers, verification table at the bottom (`make lint`, `chezmoi diff`,
  `i3 -C -c ~/.config/i3/config`, `sway … --validate`).

## Why this handoff exists

Verification is the bottleneck: **i3, i3-msg, polybar, polybar-msg, rofi and
picom binaries do not exist on thinkpad**, so every runtime/visual check of
the optiplex port has been deferred session after session. All such checks
are now queued below and in the findings doc's checklist. Do the optiplex
checks **before** starting new edit work.

## Git state

`main` = this commit, pushed. Recent history:

- `e505702` — polybar spacing/clicks match waybar; waybar made thinkpad-only.
- `598b40d` — port audit: `$mod+Shift+c` reload chain restarts polybar,
  `--release` on three toggle bindings, `[module/i3mode]` resize chip,
  `lock.sh --now` xss-lock fd contract, `xss-lock`+`xorg-xset` packages.
- this commit — (a) visual-parity fixes from user feedback, (b) `refs/`
  un-ignored and committed with reproducible material pruned.

`backup/pre-reset-2567b2d` is a **local-only** branch (not pushed); it is
historical reference material, per AGENTS.md not an architecture to restore.

## This round's fixes (all applied and thinkpad-validated)

User feedback verbatim: rofi glyph→input spacing too far, rofi padding must
match fuzzel exactly, picom shadows bottom-right instead of centered,
power-control prompts show "find something..." where "Enter=yes, Esc=no"
belongs, dunst overlaps the bar on optiplex (thinkpad sits below it), and the
"Muted" text should be dimmed. Clarifications: **only thinkpad lacked the
dimmed Muted** (polybar already dims via `label-muted-foreground`); scope =
only the reported items.

1. **Rofi padding/spacing** — `home/dot_config/rofi/config.rasi.tmpl`
   (optiplex-only). `window padding` `8px` → `8px 16px` to mirror fuzzel's
   `horizontal-pad=16` / `vertical-pad=8`; `inputbar spacing` `8px` → `2px`
   (the prompt already carries a trailing space, so 8px read as double).
   `inputbar padding-bottom` stays 8px = fuzzel `inner-pad=8`. Multi-value
   padding is CSS-style, verified in `refs/rofi/rofi-theme.5.markdown`.
   **Verify (optiplex):** `$mod+d` — search glyph hugs the input text, box
   inset 16px left/right, 8px top/bottom; compare against fuzzel memory or a
   thinkpad screenshot.
2. **Power-confirm hint** — `home/dot_config/i3/scripts/executable_power_control.sh`,
   `confirm_menu()`: the theme never renders a `message` widget, so `-mesg`
   showed nothing and only the input placeholder ("find something...") was
   visible. The hint now rides in the entry placeholder via
   `-theme-str "entry { placeholder: \"$confirm_placeholder\"; }"` (fuzzel
   passes the same string as `--placeholder`). Launcher placeholder is
   untouched. **Verify (optiplex):** `$mod+Shift+z` → prompt
   `confirm suspend? `, grey `Enter=yes, Esc=no` **inside the input box**;
   Esc/arrow-cancel works; do **not** press Enter unless you want to suspend.
3. **Dunst below the bar** — `home/dot_config/dunst/dunstrc.tmpl`
   (deploys on both machines). Wayland dunst is pushed below waybar's 24px
   exclusive zone before its `(8, 8)` offset applies (→ top at y=32); X11
   dunst measures from the screen edge with no strut awareness, so it
   overlapped the 24px polybar. Offset is now
   `(8, {{…optiplex}}32{{…else}}8{{end}})` — optiplex renders `(8, 32)`,
   identical geometry to thinkpad; thinkpad stays `(8, 8)`. **Verify
   (optiplex):** `systemctl --user restart dunst` (or `pkill dunst`;
   dbus-activation relaunches it), then
   `notify-send "geometry" "below the bar"` → 8px from right edge, top edge
   8px below the 24px bar. Also `grep offset ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc` after
   apply → must read `(8, 32)`.
4. **Waybar muted dim** (thinkpad-side) — `home/dot_config/waybar/style.css.tmpl`:
   new `#pulseaudio.muted { color: @neutral-text-muted; }`, deliberately
   placed **after** `#pulseaudio:hover` so hovering does not un-dim it
   (polybar has no hover state; equal specificity → later rule wins).
   Selector confirmed against the waybar wiki (STYLE lists
   `#pulseaudio.muted`). **Verify (thinkpad, when back):** reload waybar,
   `pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle` → `󰖁 Muted` renders grey,
   stays grey on hover; toggle back.
5. **Picom shadows — no config change, diagnose at runtime.**
   `home/dot_config/picom.conf.tmpl` already has `shadow-offset-x = 0;
   shadow-offset-y = 2`, the exact mirror of thinkpad's SwayFX
   `shadow_offset 0 2` (both near-centered, 2px down). Bottom-right shadows
   therefore mean the **running picom is not loading this config** (i3 exec
   line: `picom --config $HOME/.config/picom.conf`). Likely mechanism: a
   picom instance predating the config/exec line — i3's `restart` re-runs
   `exec` lines but a second picom exits, leaving the stale one in charge.
   **Verify/diagnose (optiplex):**
   `tr '\0' ' ' < /proc/$(pgrep -x picom)/cmdline` → must contain
   `--config …/.config/picom.conf`; `ls ~/.config/picom/` for legacy configs;
   fix with `pkill picom; i3-msg restart` (fresh exec with `--config`);
   shadows should then be horizontally centered. If they are still
   bottom-right with the config confirmed loaded, re-examine sign semantics
   against `refs/picom/picom.sample.conf` (restorable via fetch script).

## Carried verification checklist (from `refs/polybar-migration-findings.md`)

Run these on optiplex after `git pull && chezmoi apply` (the findings doc has
full wording and the source proofs behind each item):

1. `i3 -C -c ~/.config/i3/config` parses (reload chain, `border normal`
   rules, `--release` bindings).
2. `$mod+Shift+c` after a polybar edit restarts polybar, no duplicate bars.
3. `$mod+r` resize chip appears bold yellow-on-`warning-hover`, and the bar
   is pixel-identical at rest afterwards.
4. Hold-key test: DND / caffeine / drop-term toggle exactly once
   (`--release` behavior).
5. Drop-term and topgrade scratchpads float **with a titlebar**.
6. Three suspend paths lock before sleep (power menu, `systemctl suspend`,
   `xset s 30` idle); DND restores on wake.
7. Print / Shift+Print / Ctrl+Print save into `~/Pictures/Screenshots`
   (auto-created at startup); region capture works.
8. Logout stops `calibre-sync-netmon` (bound to `i3-session.target`).
9. Next apply re-runs onboarding (packages.json hash) and reports
   `xss-lock`, `xorg-xset` as new installs — by design.
10. `polybar -vvv` includes the i3 module build flag.
11. **New:** the five fixes above (rofi layout, confirm placeholder, dunst
    geometry, picom cmdline, and the thinkpad waybar muted check).

## `refs/` layout (now COMMITTED — `.gitignore` no longer lists it)

- **Committed:** `polybar-migration-findings.md` (authoritative verified
  ledger + round-2 findings), this handoff, `fetch-refs.sh`, `zellij-themes/`
  (5 `.kdl` files whose upstream source could not be located, so they are
  kept rather than scripted).
- **Deleted this session as reproducible**, restorable with
  `sh refs/fetch-refs.sh [target-dir]` (idempotent; verified byte-identical
  against the originals before deletion): clones `catppuccin-nvim`,
  `lazy-nvim`, `mason-nvim`, `onedark-pro`, `snacks-nvim`, `polybar-wiki`
  (each pinned to the commit last read); doc fetches `picom/`, `rofi/`,
  `i3/`, `i3lock-color/`, `redshift/`, `polybar/` (polybar rst subset from
  pinned commit `b3af5a33166604c689705d7dc67b69c01482d707`, same commit the
  findings doc's `/tmp` re-fetch line uses); and `dotfiles-pre-reset.bundle`
  (67M — regenerated locally from the identical
  `backup/pre-reset-2567b2d` ref, so the bytes do not belong in git).

## Deferred by user decision ("only what I reported" this round)

- picom tooltip `corner-radius = 8` vs waybar's 4px chip corners.
- dunst shadow strength vs thinkpad.
- Optional `cliphist` removal (referenced nowhere; parity already holds).
- Polybar mpris has no test twin (accepted); no `--locked` media keys on
  optiplex, flameshot vs grim/satty, xss-lock/xset vs swayidle, feh vs awww,
  redshift vs wlsunset, touchpad block, waybar tooltips, polybar mpris grace
  window — all platform-justified, accepted earlier.

## Operating notes for this session

- Order: `git pull` → read findings doc tail (checklist) → run checklist +
  this round's verifications → only then edit further.
- Config read timing: rofi reads config per launch (no restart); dunst and
  picom need a restart; polybar via `$mod+Shift+c`; waybar only on thinkpad.
- `chezmoi diff` before `chezmoi apply` on optiplex; expect onboarding
  re-run if the packages hash is newer than its recorded state.
- Validation available on optiplex that thinkpad lacked: `i3 -C`,
  `polybar -vvv`, `rofi -dump-config`, picom cmdline inspection — use them,
  they are exactly the checks that were impossible before.
