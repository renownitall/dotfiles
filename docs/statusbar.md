# Status bar

This page explains the bar at the top of the screen. It assumes you are
comfortable pressing shortcuts in Sway and nothing else. The bar follows your
active theme on its own.

The bar has three groups, as listed in the following table.

| Group  | Shows                                                              |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left   | Workspaces, resize indicator, and music                            |
| Center | Focused window title                                               |
| Right  | System stats, updates, sound, battery, tray, clock, do not disturb |

A _workspace_ is a separate screenful of windows, like a virtual desktop. The
resize indicator appears only while you resize or move windows. Long window
titles are shortened to fit the bar.

## Control music from the bar

The left side shows the current track whenever a player is active, such as a
browser or music app. It hides when nothing plays. Click the track to play or
pause. Scroll up for the next track and scroll down for the previous track.

## Install updates from the bar

The bar counts pending repo and community updates. When updates are pending, it
shows the count and names the first few packages in its tooltip. Click the count
to open `topgrade` in a scratchpad terminal. Closing the window parks it until
the next click.

For more information about package sources, see [Installation](installation.md).

## Silence notifications from the bar

Press `Super+Shift+d` or click the indicator to silence popups. Direct feedback
still appears, such as toggle and wallpaper messages. Locking the screen hides
even those. Press the shortcut or click again to let notifications through.

For more information about dismissing single messages and browsing history, see
[Pickers](pickers.md).
