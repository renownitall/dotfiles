# Palette system

Updating colors across dozens of configuration files was tedious. The _palette_
uses a single source of truth for the entire desktop. The palette is the set of
files that defines every color in this setup.

This section explains how the palette system works. It covers how the files are
organized, what the build script derives from them, why the colors stay
readable, and how templates pull values out at apply time. It is written for
people who are new to this kind of setup, so every term is defined the first
time it appears.

## Overview

The palette files live in `palettes/flint/`:

```
palettes/flint/
├── shared.yaml    # Functional roles, ANSI slots, Catppuccin aliases, app namespaces, alpha rules, contrast rules, desktop metrics
├── dark.yaml      # Flint raw hex values, dark-specific overrides, the Qt bevel ladder
└── light.yaml     # Sand raw hex values, light-specific overrides, the Qt bevel ladder
```

Before touching the files, learn two terms:

- A _raw token_ is a named color value, the actual hex like `#303030`.
- A _semantic role_ is a named job a color does, like `background` or
  `focus_border`. Roles point at tokens, and the same role can point at
  different tokens in different variants.

`scripts/build_palette_data.py` validates the palette, computes all necessary
formats and alpha blends, and writes `.chezmoidata.yaml` into `home/`. When you
run `chezmoi apply`, chezmoi reads that file and injects the colors into any
`.tmpl` configuration.

Changing a color takes the same steps every time:

1. Edit a palette file.
2. Run the build script.
3. Apply with chezmoi.

The sections that follow cover those steps, from the files to the derived data
to the checks that catch mistakes.

## How the files are structured

### The shared configuration file

The `shared.yaml` file defines everything that is not tied to a specific color
variant:

- **`semantic`.** Functional names that map roles to raw tokens, like
  `background: bg`, `accent_text: accent_blue_bright`, and
  `focus_border: overlay_strong`. Your configs mostly consume these semantic
  roles.
- **`apps`.** App-specific roles, namespaced per application. Each entry
  `apps.<app>.<key>` becomes the flat role `<app>_<key>` at load time, so
  `apps.qt.base` turns into the role `qt_base`. This keeps new applications from
  polluting the core role vocabulary.
- **`ansi`.** The standard 16-color terminal slots (`black`, `red`, `green`, and
  the rest). ANSI colors are the numbered color slots that terminals use, and
  the 16 here cover the eight basic colors plus their bright variants.
- **`catppuccin`.** A bridge to the token names another theme project uses.
  Catppuccin is a popular theme project with well-known token names like
  `crust`, `mantle`, `surface0`, and `subtext0`. Neovim plugins (like
  Catppuccin) expect those specific names. This maps them cleanly to the Flint
  theme's semantic roles, so the plugins work without extra configuration.
- **`alpha`.** Declarative opacity rules in `[base_token, alpha_float]` form,
  like `border_70: [accent, 0.7]`. Alpha is how transparent a color is, on a
  scale from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque). Declarative here means
  the rules are data, not code.
- **`lut_palette`.** Lists of color anchors (`balanced`, `cool`, `warm`) that
  `lutgen`, the wallpaper recolor tool, uses for wallpaper remapping.
- **`hue_budget`.** The hue-budget validator's data. It holds the declared hue
  families (anchors plus tolerance), the neutral saturation ceiling, the
  near-black and near-white exemptions, and the exact-token exemptions.
- **`contrast_checks`.** The contrast validator's floors, as data rows of
  `[fg_role, bg_role, min_ratio]`. Adding a check for a new role is a one-line
  edit here, not a code change.
- **`distinctness_checks`.** Adjacent-state rules as
  `[role_a, role_b, min_contrast, min_delta_e, context]` rows, covering pairs
  like hover versus focused and active versus inactive border.
- **`desktop`.** Global font names, sizes, cursor themes, and Qt style
  preferences.

### The dark and light configuration files

The `dark.yaml` and `light.yaml` files contain the actual hex values (`raw`),
_GIMP Toolkit_ (_GTK_) theme names (`appearance`), upstream Catppuccin flavors
(`mocha` versus `latte`), `semantic_overrides`, and the `qt_bevel` ladder.

A flavor is the Catppuccin term for a complete color scheme. GTK is the widget
toolkit that many Linux apps use. `semantic_overrides` is the per-variant list
of roles that point somewhere different from the shared defaults. `qt_bevel` is
the five-step Qt button ladder, declared as raw tokens from lightest to darkest
instead of hand-picked hexes. Qt is the toolkit many desktop apps are built on.
The design invariants section explains the ladder in detail.

## The accent

Every variant carries exactly one accent. It is expressed through the semantic
roles (`accent`, `accent_text`, `accent_bright`, `accent_strong`, `selection`,
and `on_selection`), not through swappable bundles. An accent is not a single
color. Pointing `accent` at one raw token breaks selection contrast and fails in
the light variant. Each accent is really three cooperating roles:

1. **Foreground text and icons.** Bright and readable against the base
   background, at 4.5:1 or more
2. **UI highlight.** Distinct for links, focus outlines, and interactive
   highlights
3. **Selection surface.** A tint with enough depth to keep the selection text
   readable, because `on_selection` against `selection` must reach 4.5:1. Flint
   uses a neutral grey-blue with near-white text. Sand uses the deep blue with
   the light background as the text color.

Window borders follow the Sway white invariant instead of the accent, the Sway
convention that the focused border takes the theme's most legible neutral color.
The `window_focused_border` role is the theme's `text` color in both variants,
light grey `#EDEDED` in Flint (the lit side of the ramp) and dark `#242424` in
Sand (the dark side), so focus is the theme's most legible neutral. Blue was
tested and rejected for this job, because the accent's hue matches the cool-grey
inactive borders and therefore has neither luminance nor hue separation. The
`focus_border` role stays the neutral `overlay_strong` grey, and the accent only
appears in text, search matches, and interactive highlights.

Both variants carry the same blue accent, one hue system at two lightness
extremes. Flint uses the Orchis selection blue (`accent_blue`) with a brighter
text variant, and Sand uses a darkened Orchis blue so text keeps its contrast
against the light background.

Both ramps are neutral. Every step of both neutral ramps measures 0% saturation,
anchored to the Orchis GTK values the desktop already uses. Dark `bg` is
`#212121` with `surface_0` at `#2C2C2C`. Light `bg` is `#F2F2F2` with the
`bg_subtle` wash at `#FAFAFA`, the Orchis base-alt value lighter than the root.
The working surfaces step downward from `bg` so the bevel keeps legible steps.

The working statuses are One Dark hues, darkened in Sand wherever the
text-contrast floors demand it. Only the failure depths are exact Orchis
Material colors (`error_deep` is red-800, `critical_bg` is red-900). The hue
budget caps neutral saturation at 10% so the ramps cannot drift warm again.

The remaining chromatic tokens are the working colors, not neutrals. They are
cyan, purple, peach, and the terminal spectrum, and each sits inside a declared
hue family. The accent stays neutral.

The accent roles (`accent`, `accent_strong`, and `accent_bright`) are shared
defaults. Only `accent_text` needs an override, because the bright blue fails
contrast on the light background, and the override lives in the light variant.

## Design invariants

The palette values encode a few deliberate rules. The validator enforces the
ones that can be measured. The rest are written down here so a future edit does
not break them by accident.

### Terminology

The rules are full of specialist terms, so this section explains them in plain
English. Each entry names the term, then says what it means and why it matters.

#### How colors are measured

- **Contrast ratio.** How readable one color is on top of another. It is a
  number like 3.0:1 or 4.5:1. A ratio of 1:1 means the two colors are identical,
  and 21:1 is black on white, the maximum-contrast pairing. The Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) set the floors most designs follow: 4.5:1 for
  normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI elements like borders and buttons, and
  7:1 for the enhanced accessibility level. In this palette, the validator
  treats those ratios as hard floors. If a pair of colors falls below its floor,
  the build aborts.
- **ΔE.** How different two colors actually look to a human eye. It is not raw
  red-green-blue (RGB) distance, because two colors can be far apart in RGB math
  while looking almost identical to a person. A ΔE of about 2.3 is the
  just-noticeable difference, and a ΔE of about 10 means the colors are clearly
  different. The validator uses ΔE to catch the classic failure where two
  "different" slots silently become the same color.
- **JND.** Short for just-noticeable difference, the ΔE threshold of about 2.3
  from the previous item. When a color step sits below it, the eye cannot tell
  the step is there, so the separation is lost. Whenever the palette separates
  two colors on purpose, the gap needs to clear the JND.

#### How colors behave on screen

- **Wash and hover tint.** A wash, or hover tint, is a barely-there background
  tint, roughly 1:1 contrast with the base color. On its own it looks like
  nothing happened, which is by design. The rule that comes out of this is
  simple. Every hover style must also flip a border or text color in the same
  transition, or the hover reads as nothing at all.
- **Bevel ladder.** Qt paints buttons as a band of five shades running from
  light to dark. If two of those steps are near-identical, the button looks
  flat. These steps stay subtle, usually in the ΔE 3 to 5 range, with one wider
  step per variant. In Flint the step from `surface_0` to `bg` is 5.3 ΔE,
  because `bg` is the desktop root and `surface_0` is the first panel shade, and
  the panel needs a clear step away from the root. In Sand the step from `bg` to
  `surface_0` is 7.4 ΔE, because the light ramp jumps from the desktop root to
  the first panel shade there. Each variant declares its ladder once as
  `qt_bevel` (raw tokens, lightest to darkest), and the build derives the
  `qt_light`, `qt_midlight`, `qt_button`, `qt_mid`, and `qt_dark` roles from it.
  It enforces a strictly monotonic ramp, and any two adjacent steps that fall
  below 1.05:1 contrast and below ΔE 4.0 at the same time are rejected as
  indistinguishable. The ladder is a contiguous slice of the neutral ramp, so it
  cannot drift out of the ramp.
- **Floor ceiling.** A floor ceiling is a color that is locked to a minimum
  contrast even when a "nicer" value dips below it. Faint text must stay
  readable. In the dark variant, the surface ladder physically cannot carry
  4.0:1 on `surface_2`, so `text_muted` on `surface_2` is floored at 3.0:1,
  which is the realistic limit. `overlay_strong` on the background gets the same
  floor.
- **Two brights in the light variant.** The word _bright_ means two different
  things in Sand, the light variant. The ANSI `bright_*` slots are darker than
  their normal counterparts, because bright text must stay readable on the light
  background. The accent and error `*_bright` colors are lighter, because they
  are hover tints meant to stand out against the base. Same word, opposite
  directions, both deliberate.
- **Swaylock slices invert per variant.** The swaylock ring hosts the keystroke,
  backspace, and caps lock arcs. In Flint the ring is mid-grey and the arcs are
  light (`ansi_white`, `yellow_bright`, and `error_bright`). In Sand the ring is
  light (`surface_2`) and the arcs are the dark chromatic tokens (`text`,
  `yellow`, and `error`). A light-variant slice must be a dark color, because
  every light-variant chromatic token is dark by design. Pointing them at
  `overlay_strong` produced 1.35:1 arcs that were invisible.

#### What the colors mean

- **One gold hue.** `caution`, `warning`, and `yellow` are deliberately the same
  amber. That means syntax yellow in the editor, UI warnings, and the caution
  meter in btop all read as one color across the desktop. The three names are
  vocabulary, not three different colors. Keeping them identical is what makes
  warnings recognizable everywhere.
- **Hue is reserved for outcomes.** Idle things stay neutral, and only states
  that mean something get color. The swaylock ring stays grey while it is
  verifying, and dunst notification cards keep the base background in every
  urgency. Color appears only for progress and failure, never for "everything is
  fine". Like the swaylock text that turns red only when the password is wrong,
  a dunst card changes its text, border, and progress colors instead of
  repainting its surface. Chroma marks the failure state, never idle or
  in-progress.
- **Accent knob.** `accent` and `accent_strong` move together per variant, blue
  in both Flint and Sand, so links and highlights stay in agreement.
  `focus_border` and `window_focused_border` are deliberately split off from the
  accent. The `window_focused_border` role uses the `text` color, light grey in
  Flint and dark in Sand, the two ends of the same neutral ramp, while the
  `focus_border` role stays the neutral `overlay_strong` grey. Window borders
  stay readable against any wallpaper, while the accent lives in text, search
  matches, and interactive highlights.
- **`fastfetch_key` stays accent-independent.** The fastfetch logo is fixed to
  the Catppuccin `peach` token, so the key color must not follow the accent hue.
  In Flint the key is the bright blue. In Sand it is the deep blue, because the
  bright blue fails contrast on the light background.
- **Terminal blue and UI blue are separate tokens.** In Flint, `ansi_blue` is
  the bright syntax blue (`#61AFEF`) and `accent_blue` is the Orchis selection
  blue (`#3281EA`). The terminal keeps the brighter one, because syntax
  highlights need the extra brightness against the dark background. The UI
  accent stays at the Orchis value, because it also paints fills, borders, and
  hover tints and must match GTK. In Sand the two stay separate as well, with
  `ansi_blue` as the muted terminal blue (`#225882`) and `accent_blue` as the
  vivid fill blue (`#166AD9`). The two blues in each variant are
  context-separated, so the similarity across roles does not matter.

#### Intentional lookalikes

- **`raw_aliases` versus `raw_near_aliases`.** `raw_aliases` are groups of names
  that must all point at the same hex value. For example, `ansi_green` and
  `success` are aliases of each other. The build warns if a group drifts apart.
  `raw_near_aliases` are pairs that are almost identical, which is fine because
  they are context-separated. Almost identical is the point. Do not "fix" one
  without checking the other.
- **Context-separated.** Two colors are context-separated when they are similar
  but never appear in the same place, so the similarity does not matter.
  Terminal text and button fill are a classic example.
- **Accepted near-collisions.** `ansi_black` and `surface_0` sit within ΔE 1.0
  of each other in Flint. That is accepted and declared in `raw_near_aliases`,
  because the two are context-separated. One is terminal black, and the other is
  the first panel shade. Keep the gap when editing either side.

#### Search highlight ladder

Search prominence comes from depth of blue, never brightness. The same
three-step structure holds in both variants:

1. **Line highlight** stays neutral (`surface0`) with no hue.
2. **Other matches** (`search_bg`) are the lighter sibling in the accent-blue
   family, with whichever text contrast wins.
3. **Current match** (`inc_search_bg`) is the deepest, most saturated blue of
   the ladder, with light text.

Do not push a search fill toward the white-blue range. Colors in that range look
flashy, and they stop following the depth-of-blue structure. In Flint the ladder
is `#7FB3F0` for other matches over `#3281EA` for the current match. In Sand it
is `#4178a3` over `#166AD9`. The zathura `highlight-active` color follows
`search_bg` at 80% alpha (`search_80`) and must track any change to step 2.

## What the build script derives

When `build_palette_data.py` runs, it derives multiple ready-to-use formats for
every token, so templates do not have to reformat values by hand.

### Solid colors

The `.flint.resolved.<role>` and `.flint.raw.<token>` paths expose the solid
forms:

- `.hex` is `#282828`, the standard six-digit form.
- `.bare` is `282828`, without the leading hash. The foot terminal emulator and
  Qt5ct, the Qt style configuration tool, use it.
- `.triple` is `40 40 40`, space-separated RGB. Zellij KDL needs it.
- `.bare_ff` is `282828ff`, with the alpha channel included. Fuzzel and swaylock
  use it.

### Alpha tokens

Alpha tokens represent transparent overlays. The derived `.hex` and `.bare`
forms are 8-digit hex, like `#3281EAb2`, for apps that parse alpha such as
swaylock and zathura. The `.rgba` form is a _Cascading Style Sheets_ (_CSS_)
`rgba(r, g, b, a)` string for waybar.

## Contrast checks

`flint_palette.py` has a built-in contrast validator that runs every time you
build the palette data. The floors themselves live as data in `shared.yaml`
(`contrast_checks` for paired contrast floors, `distinctness_checks` for
adjacent-state rules), so adding a rule for a new role is a data edit. The
validator runs WCAG relative luminance math, a measure of how bright a color
looks to the eye, across every variant. It enforces these floors:

- Primary text on background must be at least 4.5:1 (WCAG AA).
- Secondary and muted text on surfaces must meet at least 4.0:1 to 4.5:1.
- Interactive borders and status highlights must meet at least 3.0:1.
- Selection text, meaning `on_selection` against `selection`, must meet at least
  4.5:1.
- ANSI text must maintain at least 4.5:1 against the terminal background, and
  bright variants must have a measurable visual distinction from normal variants
  (1.05:1 or more).
- LUT anchor palettes must contain at least 12 anchors, and any two anchors
  inside one list must stay at least ΔE 3.0 apart, just above the
  just-noticeable difference, so `lutgen` does not produce visible color
  banding, stepped edges that appear when a smooth gradient changes in coarse
  jumps, on complex wallpapers. The floor is data in `lut_min_anchor_delta_e`,
  and the build rejects lists that contain near-identical anchors.

The hue-budget validator guards the neutrality thesis in code, the rule that hue
is reserved for outcomes and everything else stays neutral. Every raw token must
be near-neutral (saturation at or below 10%), near-black or near-white, or fall
within 10 degrees of one of the eight declared hue families (red, orange,
yellow, green, mint, cyan, blue, and purple, covering the Orchis accents and the
terminal spectrum). The `diff_*` washes and `warning_tint` are exempt, because
they are intentional low-contrast tints. Any token that drifts outside the
budget aborts the build.

If any pair fails to meet its contrast floor, the build script prints the
failures and aborts before you can apply broken colors.

## Template usage

The export contains both variants. `flint.dark` and `flint.light` hold the full
per-variant data, so apps that render both variants can be configured for both
at once. The template for the foot terminal emulator, for example, renders
`[colors-dark]` and `[colors-light]` side by side. The top-level sections
(`resolved`, `alpha`, `ansi_resolved`, and `catppuccin_resolved`) alias the
active variant, so most templates keep reading `.flint.resolved` and
automatically follow `make dark` and `make light`.

Any file ending in `.tmpl` can read values directly from `.flint`. The swaylock
template shows the pattern, pulling roles from the active variant alias and
writing them into the config:

```ini
# Pattern from home/dot_config/swaylock/config.tmpl
#{{ $c := .flint.resolved }}

ring-color={{ $c.swaylock_ring.bare_ff }}
inside-color={{ $c.background.bare_ff }}
text-color={{ $c.text.bare_ff }}
```

[Switch variants](theming.md#switch-variants) in the theming section.
