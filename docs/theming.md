# Themes

This page explains how colors work in this repository. It covers where the
colors come from, how they get into your config files, how to switch between the
dark and light variants, and how wallpapers are recolored to match. It is
written for people who are new to this kind of setup, so every term is defined
the first time it appears.

Everything inside this repository uses a custom theme called Flint (dark) and
its light counterpart, Sand. Flint is a neutral grey theme whose chrome matches
Orchis, the GTK theme of this desktop, with its working colors drawn from the
One Dark terminal spectrum. The two variants exist so the desktop can follow the
dark and light appearance settings with every app switching at the same time.
They are applied to every app config in this repo except Vesktop, which keeps
its own styling and only inherits fonts.

## The color pipeline

One set of files defines every color, and everything else is derived from it.
Nothing in this repository hardcodes a hex value twice. A hex value is a color
written as six hexadecimal digits, like `#3281EA`.

The pipeline has three stages:

1. **Palette files.** The colors are defined in `palettes/flint/`, split into a
   shared file and one file per variant. This is where you edit a color by hand.
2. **The build script.** `scripts/build_palette_data.py` reads those files,
   validates every color, and exports the active variant into
   `.chezmoidata.yaml` in the effective chezmoi source root, which is `home/` in
   this repo.
3. **Templates.** The config files themselves are stored as `.tmpl` files. At
   apply time, chezmoi fills them in with the color data and writes the finished
   configs into your home directory.

So changing a color means editing one file and re-applying. The rest happens
automatically.

For more information about the architecture, see
[the palette system architecture](palette-system.md).

## The two variants

The theme has two variants. The `dark` variant is Flint and the `light` variant
is Sand.

Each variant carries exactly one accent, built into the semantic roles
(`accent`, `accent_text`, `accent_bright`, `accent_strong`, `selection`, and
`on_selection`). Both Flint and Sand use the same blue accent, one hue system at
two lightness extremes. The neutrals of both variants are true greys matching
the Orchis GTK theme, not tints. The blue accent carries the strong hue in the
chrome.

Window borders are the one deliberate exception. The `window_focused_border`
role follows the theme's `text` color instead of the accent, light grey in Flint
and dark in Sand. The `focus_border` role stays the neutral `overlay_strong`
grey in both variants, so window borders stay neutral against any wallpaper.

A semantic role is a named job that a color does, like `background` or a focused
window border. The actual color behind a role can change per variant, but the
role name stays the same, which is why your configs can refer to roles instead
of hex values.

## Switch variants

Export the variant you want, then apply with these commands:

```sh
make dark && chezmoi apply
make light && chezmoi apply
```

`make dark` runs the palette build script. The script validates the colors and
exports the dark variant into `.chezmoidata.yaml`. The `make light` target does
the same for Sand.

The generated `home/.chezmoidata.yaml` file is local-only and does not belong in
version control. It is excluded by Git, because it changes every time you switch
variants.

## Wallpaper theming

The repo also includes a helper called `flint-wallpaper` that uses
[lutgen-rs](https://github.com/ozwaldorf/lutgen-rs) to recolor arbitrary
wallpapers to match Flint or Sand. It caches both the generated recolor data and
output images, so later runs reuse the cached results.

A _lookup table_ (_LUT_) is a mapping that lutgen produces from your theme
colors, used to shift every pixel of an image toward those colors. Generating a
LUT is the expensive part, so the helper generates it once and reuses it until
something about the theme changes.

LUT palette templates live in `home/dot_config/lutgen/`. The `flint.tmpl`,
`flint-cool.tmpl`, and `flint-warm.tmpl` files get rendered from the active
theme data on apply.

```sh
# Recolor an image to match the active theme and set it as the wallpaper
flint-wallpaper --set ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/scenery.jpg

# Force a specific variant or palette
flint-wallpaper --theme light --palette warm --set ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/scenery.jpg

# Use Gaussian RBF instead of blur
flint-wallpaper --rbf --shape 96.0 --set ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/scenery.jpg
```

In these examples, `--theme light` forces the light variant. `--palette warm`
picks the warm palette template. `--rbf` switches from the default blur-based
recoloring to a _Gaussian radial basis function_ (_RBF_) method with the given
shape value.

The helper is not bound to any keyboard shortcut. When a wallpaper path is set,
the script that applies the theme runs it after each variant switch, so the
wallpaper matches the active variant without extra steps. Run
`flint-wallpaper --help` for usage.
