# Session manager

This section explains what the session manager does. It covers when your desktop
gets saved, when it comes back, and what comes back with it. It is written for
people who are new to this kind of setup, so every term is defined the first
time it appears.

## Overview

A session is the set of windows open on your desktop, with the workspaces they
sit on, their layouts, and their open files. A workspace is a separate screenful
of windows, like a virtual desktop. The session manager is a small Python
program that saves that state when you leave and rebuilds it when you come back.
It lives at `~/.config/sway/scripts/session_manager`, with the real code in
`session_manager_lib/` next to it.

## Save the session

Saving is wired into the power controls in the SwayFX config. When you log out,
power off, or reboot, the session is saved to `~/.local/state/sway_session.json`
first, then the action happens. Suspend does not save, because the session keeps
running while the machine sleeps.

## Restore the session

Restoring happens at login. On startup you get a `fuzzel` menu, the same
keyboard-driven picker used for the launcher and the history menus. It asks
**restore previous session?**, with options for **restore** and **start fresh**.
Type or press `Up` and `Down`, then press `Enter` to choose and `Escape` to
start fresh. Choose **restore**, and the manager relaunches your apps and
rebuilds the desktop. The menu waits 15 seconds. If you make no choice, nothing
is restored. Silence counts as a no.

The prompt only appears when there is something to bring back. You are not asked
at all when the state file is missing, or when the previous session was empty
with no windows, scratchpad entries, or background apps. The dropdown terminal,
the hidden one on `Super`+`` ` ``, does not count on its own, since its
keybinding spawns it whenever it is missing.

## Restored content

The restore covers the following:

- Workspaces, layouts, floating windows, the scratchpad, marks, geometry, and
  fullscreen state
- Terminals with their working directories, including Neovim sessions inside
  them
- Open documents, down to the page of the PDF you were reading in zathura, the
  PDF reader.
- The browser, restored with a single launch of Helium's
  `--restore-last-session` flag, then matched back to the windows you had.
- Apps that live in the tray, the panel's icon area, with no visible window,
  like a minimized Vesktop, the Discord client.

The scratchpad is the hidden workspace that holds parked windows, and marks are
labels attached to individual windows.

## Quality checks

If you change the code in `session_manager_lib/`, there is a quality gate you
can run to verify nothing broke. The repository `Makefile` has a `check` target
for it. It runs the linter, the formatter, a type check, and the whole test
suite of the session manager library, and it stops at the first problem it
finds.

Run it from the repository root:

    make check

The gate uses `uv`, a fast Python package manager, to pull in the tools it
needs, so it works without a local virtual environment.
