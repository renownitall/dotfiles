"""
Provides the Waybar MPRIS module script.

The script uses a hybrid of event handling and polling. The `playerctl --follow`
stream provides instant, event-driven updates. A periodic resync every
`POLL_INTERVAL` seconds queries authoritative state and corrects whatever the
follow stream misses or gets wrong.

The script emits Waybar-compatible JSON to stdout. An empty payload when
no player is active lets Waybar's `hide-empty-text` collapse the module
cleanly.

The two approaches cover for each other. Polling alone is reliable but
slow, adding up to one second of latency to every play, pause, or track
change. The `--follow` stream alone reacts instantly, but it misses or
coalesces rapid `PropertiesChanged` bursts, stops emitting when a browser's
MPRIS instance churns, and passes through Chromium-family quirks. Running
both through one state machine gives instant updates with self-healing.

Three safety nets compensate for those browser quirks:

- The last-known-good cache keeps showing the previous artist and title
  while a player is Playing or Paused but its metadata is momentarily
  empty. Chromium clears `Metadata` during long pauses and track changes.
- Position-stall pause detection handles the case where Chromium reports
  `PlaybackStatus` "Playing" while actually paused. A frozen non-zero
  `{{position}}` across consecutive readings renders as Paused.
- The grace window keeps the cached song visible through Chromium's brief
  empty or Stopped state during track transitions.

The script emits only actual state changes, so Waybar is not re-rendered
on every event.
